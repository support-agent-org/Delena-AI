Execute TypeScript/JavaScript code in a sandboxed Deno environment with access to all of OpenCode's built-in tools as async functions.

Use this tool when you need to:
- Chain multiple tool calls together with logic (loops, conditionals, error handling)
- Process or transform tool outputs programmatically
- Perform complex multi-step operations that would be tedious as individual tool calls
- Run computations, data transformations, or aggregations on tool results

The sandbox has access to the following functions:

${signatures}

## Usage Rules

- Use `await` for ALL function calls — they are async.
- Use `console.log()` to produce output — only logged values appear in the result.
- You may use standard TypeScript/JavaScript features (variables, loops, conditionals, async/await, try/catch, etc.).
- Do NOT import modules — only the functions listed above are available.
- The code runs in a fresh isolate each time; there is no state between calls.

## Examples

Read a file and count its lines:
```typescript
const result = await read({ filePath: "/path/to/file.ts" });
const lines = result.split("\n").length;
console.log(`File has ${lines} lines`);
```

Search for a pattern and read matching files:
```typescript
const matches = await grep({ pattern: "TODO", include: "*.ts" });
console.log(`Found TODOs in: ${matches}`);
```

Batch file operations:
```typescript
const files = await glob({ pattern: "src/**/*.test.ts" });
console.log(`Found test files:\n${files}`);
```
